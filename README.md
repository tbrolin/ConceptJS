## Synopsis

unIts is a modular KISS framework for javascript projects. It makes it possible to
structure code in units with well defined interfaces. It also presents the
notion of dependency management between theese unIts.

## Code Example

First define a unit:

    // unIts.define(name?, dependencies?, codeFn?)
    unIts.define('calc', [], function () {
      var API = {};

      API.add = function (a, b) {
        return a + b;
      };

      return API;
    });

Then use it:

    var calculator = unIts('calc');
    var result = calculator.add(2, 4); // result === 6 ...

## Motivation

What's so special with this? Well nothing really, and that I guess is what's so
special about it. I wanted to write modular javascript code with as little magic
as possible. A definite goal was that it should be extremely TDD-friendly, write
a unit test then write the unit (hence the name duh).

## Installation

- git clone *url*
- npm install
- grunt

...or just copy the content of src/un.units.js to somewhere nice.

## API Reference

### `unIts()`

returns the unIts version

### `unIts(unitName)`

if defined, returns the api, if any, of the unit with the name *unitName* (Uh, yes,
if it is a string that is...)

### `unIts(unitDefinition)`

extracts the api, if any, from the unit defined by the *unitDefinition*. The 
*unitDefinition* is an object as returned by the `unIts.define()` function.

### `unIts.define(unitName?, dependencies?, unitFunction?)`

Explanation coming soon.
