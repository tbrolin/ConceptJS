## Synopsis

unIts is a KISS modular framework for javascript projects. It makes it possible to
structure code in units with well defined interfaces. It also presents the
notion of dependency management between theese unIts.

## Code Example

First define a unit:

```javascript
    // unIts.define(name?, dependencies?, codeFn?)
    unIts.define('calc', [], function () {
      var API = {};

      API.add = function (a, b) {
        return a + b;
      };

      return API;
    });
```

Then use it:

```javascript
    var calculator = unIts('calc');
    var result = calculator.add(2, 4); // result === 6 ...
```

## Motivation

What's so special with this? Well nothing really, and that I guess is what's so
special about it. I wanted to write modular javascript code with as little magic
as possible. A definite goal was that it should be extremely TDD-friendly, write
a unit test then write the unit (hence the name duh).

## Installation

- git clone *url*
- npm install
- grunt

...or just copy the content of src/un.units.js to somewhere nice.

## API Reference

### `unIts()`

Returns the unIts version

### `unIts(unitName)`

If defined, returns an api-instance, if any, of the unit with the name *unitName* (uh, yes,
if it is a string that is...), If no unit with *unitName* is defined it will `throw`, also,
if any unit specified as a dependency (see below) to the unit is not defined it will
`throw`.

Any arguments after *unitName* gets passed to the *unitFunction* (see below) of the unit.

### `unIts(unitDefinition)`

Extracts an api-instance, if any, from the unit defined by the *unitDefinition*. The
*unitDefinition* is an object as returned by the `unIts.define()` function. If
it does not recognize *unitDefinition* as a, well, unit-definition object, it
will `throw`.

### `unIts.define(unitName?, dependencies?, unitFunction?)`

Ok, so *unitName* is a `string`, *dependencies* is an `Array` of strings and
*unitFunction* is a `Function`. The arguments are all optional, however the
order which they are specified in is not.

The function returns a *unitDefinition* `object`.

#### *unitName*

If provided, this is the identifier of the unit and is used with the `unIts(unitName)`
function to get an api-instance of the unit.

#### *dependencies*

An array of *unitName*s that the unit depends on. Dependencies are checked at evaluation
time (when the unit is asked for) and not on definition time.

#### *unitFunction*

The *unitFunction* is the core of the unit. It returns an api-instance of the unit
(if it has one).

## Examples

TODO: Come up with a nifty example!
